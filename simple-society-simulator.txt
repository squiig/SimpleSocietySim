
SIMPLE SOCIETY SIMULATOR
------------------------

- citizens always and only want to grow their net worth, PROFIT is the core of the game

- citizens have NO INHERENT ASSETS OR TOOLS to drive productivity (like their bodies/energy)

- every non-monetary action symbolically does cost MONEY, instead of energy. TRAVEL, for example.

- citizens get a STARTING CAPITAL to get things going

- citizens have a variety of BUSINESS STRATEGIES:

	- gathering stuff (i.e. base productivity)

	- trading (for which they have to find trading partners themselves)

	- setting up a shop (makes it easier for buyers to find sellers)

	- selling services? (complicated, labor has no inherent value)


REMINDERS:

- an ECONOMY is driven by PRODUCTIVITY

- FACTORS of PRODUCTION:
	1. land / natural resources (free gifts of nature)
	2. workers/labor
	3. capital (man-made things that help in the production of goods and services: machines, factories, infrastructure, etc. but also worker knowledge/skills)
	4. technology (production organizational effectiveness, i.e. how you combine the other factors)

- for now, the productivity in this simulator is the act of GATHERING res boxes (so, natural resources) 

- an ECONOMY grows through economic freedom and an icrease of PRODUCTIVITY

IDEAS for later:

- citizens investing in existing shops (e.g. lending, or buying shares)
- you can GOVERN the economy
- you can PARTAKE in the economy
- citizens being able to own and trade land
